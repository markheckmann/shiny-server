  <p class="info_text"> The biplot is the central way to create a joint plot of elements and constructs. Depending on te parameters chosen it contains information on the distances between elements and constructs. Also the relative values the elements have on a construct can be read off by projetion the element onto the construct vector. A lot of parameters can be changed rendering different types of biplots (ESA, Slater's) and different looks (colors, text size). See the example section below to get started. </p>
